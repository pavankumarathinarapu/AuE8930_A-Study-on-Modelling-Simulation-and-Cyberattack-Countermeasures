This project aims to design and implement a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) using MATLAB Simulink. It also explores cybersecurity aspects related to EVs.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as a sustainable
and efficient alternative to conventional vehicles powered by
fossil fuels. EVs use electric motors and batteries to propel
themselves, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel
consumption. However, EVs also face some challenges, such as
limited driving range, high cost, and vulnerability to
cyberattacks. In this paper, we address two important aspects of
EVs: fuel cells and cybersecurity.
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical
energy into electrical energy, without combustion or pollution.
Fuel cells have been proposed as a promising technology for
electrified transportation, especially for heavy-duty vehicles
such as trucks and ships, because they offer high energy density,
long durability, and fast refueling. Fuel cells can also
complement batteries, which are ideal for energy storage but
have lower energy density and longer charging time. However,
fuel cells also have some drawbacks, such as high cost, low
efficiency, and hydrogen storage issues. In this paper, we review
the current state of fuel cell technology and its applications in
EVs and discuss the prospects and challenges.
Cybersecurity is another critical issue for EVs, as they rely on
complex software and communication systems to operate. EVs
are exposed to various cyber threats, such as remote hacking,
denial-of-service attacks, data theft, and physical tampering.
These threats can compromise the safety, privacy, and
performance of EVs and their users. Cybersecurity is especially
important for EVs that use fuel cells, as they involve additional
components and interfaces that can be exploited by attackers. In
this paper, we analyze the cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities
of EVs, with a focus on fuel cells, and propose some
countermeasures and best practices to enhance their security.
The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive
overview of fuel cells and cybersecurity in EVs, and to identify
the gaps and opportunities for future research. The paper is
organized as follows: Section II presents the background and
motivation of fuel cells and their applications in EVs; Section III
discusses the cybersecurity challenges and solutions for EVs, with
an emphasis on fuel cells; Section IV-VI concludes the paper and
suggests some directions for future work.
